# Life Expectancy Prediction App

This repository contains the source code and resources for a **Life Expectancy Prediction App**, which utilizes a machine learning model to predict life expectancy based on various socioeconomic and health-related factors. The app is built using **Streamlit** and can be deployed for interactive user engagement.

## About the Project
The **Life Expectancy Prediction App** is designed to provide an interactive way for users to estimate life expectancy based on country-specific data. This project aims to:
- Help researchers and policymakers identify factors influencing life expectancy.
- Enable users to explore relationships between features such as **BMI**, **income composition**, and **health indicators**.

---

## Features
- Interactive input fields for key predictors like country, income composition, BMI, and others.
- Real-time predictions generated by a trained **Linear Regression model**.
- Visualizations for data insights and feature relationships.
- User-friendly deployment via **Streamlit**.

---

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and set up the environment.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- Required Python libraries: `streamlit`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `joblib`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/life-expectancy-prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd life-expectancy-prediction

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

---

## Usage
- Open the app in your browser after running the command.
- Enter the input values for features such as Country, BMI, Alcohol consumption, etc.
- Click the "Predict" button to get the life expectancy prediction.

## Dataset
This project uses a publicly available dataset on **Life Expectancy**, covering the years 2000 to 2015 across various countries. The dataset explores numerous factors affecting life expectancy, including:

1. **Immunization Factors**: Includes data on Hepatitis B, Polio, and Diphtheria immunization rates.
2. **Mortality Factors**: Examines metrics such as infant and adult mortality rates.
3. **Economic Factors**: Considers variables like income composition and expenditure.
4. **Social Factors**: Includes data such as schooling years and access to healthcare.
5. **Health-Related Factors**: Accounts for disease prevalence like HIV/AIDS and access to basic sanitation.

This dataset is valuable because it incorporates a mixed-effects model and multiple linear regression based on 15 years of data, allowing for more comprehensive insights compared to prior studies that often focused on a single year.

### Dataset Summary
The observations in the dataset are categorized by country, making it easier for specific regions to identify critical factors contributing to lower life expectancy. By analyzing these factors, policymakers can prioritize interventions to improve population health and longevity.

### Source
You can find the dataset and additional details [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who).

### Usage
The dataset was preprocessed to:
- Handle missing values.
- Normalize numeric variables.
- One-hot encode categorical data like countries.

It is used as the training and testing data for the regression model implemented in this project.

## Model Details
### Features
- **Numerical Features**: Life Expectancy, Adult Mortality, Schooling, BMI, etc.
- **Categorical Features**: Country, Status (Developed/Developing), etc.

### Model Training
The model was trained using:
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
- **Cross-Validation**: K-Fold (K=5) to assess generalization.

### Performance
The model’s performance was evaluated on both training and test datasets, with the following metrics:
- **R² Score**: 0.59
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 5.69

---

## Evaluation Metrics
To ensure a robust evaluation, the following metrics were used:
- **R² Score**: Measures how well the predictions fit the data. An R² score closer to 1 indicates a better fit.
- **RMSE**: Measures the average magnitude of the error between predictions and actual values. Lower RMSE indicates better performance.

### Baseline Comparison
The baseline metric was calculated as 7.681453420509873.
